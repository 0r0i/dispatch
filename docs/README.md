# Dispatch

Welcome to Dispatch's documentation! What is Dispatch? At it's most basic level Dispatch help manage incidents and crisis. Originally developed by the SIRT (Security Incident Response Team) at Netflix we found that there was a lot of manual record keeping when managing incidents and wrote Dispatch to help us focus on resolving incidents.

## Crisis Management vs Incident Response

Throughout Dispatch's documentation you will often see these two phrases use interchangable. For Dispatch and our usage of it, they both boil down to the same thing -- the process of guiding teams through unexpected events quickly and efficently.

## People Resolve Incidents

Dispatch was created with one motto in mind; "People Resolve Incidents" all the tooling and analytics and processes in the world are great; but without right individuals actively engaged in resolving an incident you're going to have a bad time.

As such Dispatch aims not to automate people out of incident response but instead to augment their abilities, allowing them to focus on what humans are good at; solving complex and ambigous questions, not record keeping or creating resources.
