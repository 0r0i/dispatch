Wat is Dispatch? In one line, we would describe Dispatch as:

_All of the ad-hoc things youâ€™re doing to manage incidents today, done for you, and much more!_

Generally, this means creating resources, assembling participants, sending out notifications, tracking tasks, and assisting with post-incident reviews.
